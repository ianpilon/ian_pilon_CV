    "summary": "I build at the edges of what's emerging. Over a decade, I've founded communities around nascent technologies—IoT Waterloo (Canada's largest IoT network), ETHWaterloo (world's largest Ethereum hackathon in 2017), and now AI Agents Waterloo. I'm drawn to the intersection of technology and human potential: leading product and AI solutions at Input Output Global, developing NeuroKick (a privacy-focused leadership sidekick), and writing \"Cultivating Clarity\" about discerning what matters using contextual intelligence. Whether it's organizing the world's first Agent-to-Agent Payments Hackathon or convening 400+ developers around decentralized tech, I'm energized by spotting patterns early and creating the conditions for interesting people to collide and build together.",
